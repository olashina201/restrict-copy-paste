# VSCode Prevent Copy-Paste Extension


## Description

The VSCode Prevent Copy-Paste extension is a productivity tool for developers working in Visual Studio Code. It addresses the common challenge of accidental code leakage by preventing developers from copying and pasting code outside the current workspace.

## Advantages

- **Enhanced Security:** Protect your codebase by restricting the copying and pasting of sensitive information outside the project's workspace, reducing the risk of unintentional data exposure.

- **Code Consistency:** Encourage developers to maintain code integrity within the designated project, promoting a consistent coding style and structure.

- **Workspace Focus:** Keep developers focused on the task at hand by discouraging the use of copied code from unrelated projects or external sources.

- **Developer Awareness:** The extension notifies users with an information message when activated, ensuring developers are aware of the restriction and fostering a more conscious coding environment.

- **Easy Integration:** Seamlessly integrate the extension into your development workflow with a simple installation process and minimal configuration. It works automatically within the current workspace.

Improve your team's coding practices and enhance the security of your projects with the VSCode Prevent Copy-Paste extension.
